# Google Sheets Based Website

On this experiment I created a statically generated website that
gets the data from Google Sheets and displays content based on that.

For the demo it load a list of people from an example spreadsheet.

## Features

✅ Load Google Sheets spreadsheet data from API and render website
✅ Use Telegram avatar images based on Telegram usernames
✅ Webhook that triggers Vercel re-deployment when Google Sheet changes
[] A way to authorize the Google API key to access private spreadsheets


## Next

- Show little icons in cards indicating data availability
- Share on...
- Make proposal for money loops at...
- Publish to Vercel and at https://gsheets-based-website.zequez.space
- Re-publish it automatically when Google Sheet changes
